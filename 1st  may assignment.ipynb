    "\n",
    "- A contingency matrix, also known as a confusion matrix, is a table that compares the predicted class labels of a classification model with the actual class labels of the data. It provides a clear overview of the model's performance by displaying true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) counts. From the contingency matrix, various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be calculated, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the model's predictive capabilities."

    "\n",
    "A pair confusion matrix is a modified version of the regular confusion matrix used in multi-label classification tasks. It represents the classification performance for each pair of classes, rather than individual classes. In multi-label scenarios where classes are not mutually exclusive, the pair confusion matrix provides more detailed insights into the model's performance for each class pair, which can be beneficial for identifying specific patterns or interactions between classes."

    "\n",
    "In the context of natural language processing (NLP), an extrinsic measure evaluates the performance of language models based on their effectiveness in real-world tasks or applications. It assesses how well the language model performs in downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or machine translation. Extrinsic measures provide a more practical and meaningful evaluation of NLP models by focusing on their actual utility and applicability in real-world scenarios."

    "In the context of machine learning, an intrinsic measure evaluates the performance of a model based on its internal characteristics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, without considering its application in real-world tasks. It focuses on the model's ability to learn from the training data and make predictions on the test data. In contrast, an extrinsic measure assesses the model's performance in real-world tasks or applications, providing a more practical evaluation of its usefulness and effectiveness in solving specific problems.\n",
