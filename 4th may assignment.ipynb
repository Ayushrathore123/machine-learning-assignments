    "For monthly sales data, I would recommend considering a Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model. This type of model accounts for both the seasonal patterns and the autoregressive and moving average components in the data. Since retail sales often exhibit recurring patterns based on seasons or holidays, a SARIMA model can effectively capture these fluctuations and provide accurate forecasts for future sales.
