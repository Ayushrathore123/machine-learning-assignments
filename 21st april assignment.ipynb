    "metric in KNN? How might this difference affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in KNN is the way they calculate the distance between data points. Euclidean distance measures the straight-line distance between points, while Manhattan distance calculates the distance as the sum of absolute differences along each feature axis. This difference may impact the KNN performance when the data has varying scales or the relationships between features are not linear, as Euclidean distance tends to emphasize large differences between features, while Manhattan distance is more robust to such variations."

    "used to determine the optimal k value?\n",
    "\n",
    "- To choose the optimal value of 'k' for a KNN classifier or regressor, cross-validation techniques are commonly used. By evaluating the model's performance on different 'k' values using techniques like k-fold cross-validation, grid search, or random search, one can select the 'k' value that yields the best performance on the validation set. This helps in avoiding overfitting (low 'k') or underfitting (high 'k') and finding the best balance between bias and variance for the KNN model."

    "\n",
    "- The choice of distance metric can significantly impact the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor. In situations where the data has varying scales or nonlinear relationships between features, Manhattan distance may be more suitable due to its robustness to such variations. On the other hand, if the data has consistent scales and linear relationships between features, Euclidean distance could be preferred as it captures geometric distances more accurately. The choice should be based on the characteristics of the data and the specific problem at hand."
