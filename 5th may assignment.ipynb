    "Q1. What is meant by time-dependent seasonal components?\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-dependent seasonal components refer to patterns in time series data that exhibit regular fluctuations at specific time intervals. These fluctuations are consistent across different periods within the same year. Unlike calendar-dependent seasonal components, which are tied to specific dates (e.g., holidays), time-dependent components are linked to time lags within a given season.\n",

    "- Industry: Different industries have unique seasonal patterns based on consumer behavior (e.g., retail sales during holidays).\n",
    "-  Geography: Geographic location can impact seasonality due to climate variations, holidays, and cultural events.\n",
    "- Economic Factors: Economic conditions, like economic cycles or major events, can influence seasonality.\n",

    "Q4. How are autoregression models used in time series analysis and forecasting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoregression models are used in time series analysis and forecasting to capture the relationship between a variable and its own past values. In autoregressive models (AR), the current value of the variable is expressed as a linear combination of its past values, introducing a lag parameter (p). This allows the model to identify and project trends and patterns inherent in the data. Autoregression is often combined with other components like moving average (MA) and differencing (I) in ARIMA models for more accurate forecasts."
