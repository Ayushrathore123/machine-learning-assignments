    "Data encoding is the process of converting data from one representation or format to another, typically from a human-readable form to a machine-readable one. It is useful in data science as it allows for the transformation of categorical or textual data into numerical or binary representations, which can be utilized by machine learning algorithms. Encoding enables the inclusion of categorical information in models, facilitating the analysis and interpretation of data, and improving predictive performance."
