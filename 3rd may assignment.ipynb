    "Q1. What is the role of feature selection in anomaly detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The role of feature selection in anomaly detection is to identify and choose the most relevant and informative features from the dataset. By selecting the right features, it helps improve the anomaly detection model's performance and efficiency, as irrelevant or redundant features can introduce noise and increase computation costs. Proper feature selection can lead to a more focused and accurate representation of data, enhancing the ability to detect anomalies effectively."

    "Q3. What is DBSCAN and how does it work for clustering?\n",
    "- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups data points based on their density in the feature space. It works by identifying core points, which have a minimum number of neighboring points within a specified radius (eps), and then expands clusters by connecting directly-reachable points. Data points that do not belong to any cluster are considered outliers or noise. DBSCAN is effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes and handling data with varying densities."

    "\n",
    "- The epsilon (eps) parameter in DBSCAN controls the neighborhood size for defining core points and directly-reachable points. A smaller epsilon value will result in tighter and more compact clusters, potentially making it harder to detect anomalies that are far away from these clusters. Conversely, a larger epsilon value may lead to larger and looser clusters, increasing the likelihood of falsely including anomalies within clusters, reducing the algorithm's sensitivity to outliers. Selecting an appropriate epsilon value is crucial for achieving optimal anomaly detection performance with DBSCAN."

Noise points, also known as outliers, have fewer neighbors than minPts and do not belong to any cluster.\n",

    "- From an anomaly detection perspective, noise points in DBSCAN can be considered potential anomalies as they are data points that do not fit well into any cluster. Border points might also be considered as borderline anomalies, lying at the edge of clusters and potentially having characteristics of both normal and anomalous instances. Core points are less likely to be anomalies as they are representative of dense regions in the dataset. However, the definition of anomalies in DBSCAN depends on the specific context and the distribution of the data.\n",
