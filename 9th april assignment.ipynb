    "Answer: \n",
    "- Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory. It describes how to update our beliefs about an event based on new evidence. It calculates the probability of an event A given that event B has occurred, by combining the prior probability of A with the likelihood of B given A and the overall probability of B"

    " - Bayes' theorem is derived from conditional probability. It provides a way to calculate the conditional probability of an event A given event B by relating it to the conditional probability of event B given event A. Bayes' theorem offers a formal framework for updating our beliefs about an event based on observed evidence or conditional probabilities."
