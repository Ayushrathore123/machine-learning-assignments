    "\n",
    "- K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning data into K clusters based on similarity. It works by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster centroid and then updating the centroids based on the mean of the data points assigned to each cluster. This process continues until the centroids stabilize, optimizing the sum of squared distances between data points and their respective cluster centroids."

    "- Determining the optimal number of clusters in K-means clustering is known as the \"elbow method.\" It involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (inertia) against the number of clusters (K) and looking for an \"elbow\" point where the inertia starts to level off. Another approach is the silhouette score, which measures how well data points fit within their clusters relative to other clusters. The optimal K corresponds to the highest silhouette score. Additionally, domain knowledge and problem-specific considerations can guide the choice of K."

To address these challenges, one can use techniques like multiple initializations of centroids and choosing the best result based on the lowest inertia or silhouette score. Additionally, for non-linear data, using kernelized K-means or exploring other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Gaussian Mixture Models can be beneficial."
