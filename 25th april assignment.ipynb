By decomposing the matrix in this way, we can understand how the matrix transforms data along its principal directions. For example, in the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the covariance matrix of the data is decomposed into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvectors define the principal components (directions of maximum variance) while the eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained along each principal component. This approach allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving its most important information along these principal directions."
