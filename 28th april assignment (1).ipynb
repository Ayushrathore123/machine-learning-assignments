    "Q1. What is hierarchical clustering, and how is it different from other clustering techniques?\n",
    "- Hierarchical clustering is a clustering technique that creates a tree-like structure of nested clusters, known as a dendrogram. It differs from other clustering techniques like K-means by not requiring the number of clusters to be predetermined. Hierarchical clustering starts with each data point as an individual cluster and then merges or divides clusters based on similarity, creating a hierarchy of clusters that can be explored at various levels of granularity."

    "\n",
    "Divisive: It begins with all data points in a single cluster and then splits the cluster into smaller ones at each step, recursively dividing the data until each data point forms its own cluster. This process continues until the desired number of clusters is achieved."

By examining the dendrogram, one can look for a significant increase in inter-cluster distance, called a \"knee\" point, to identify the ideal number of clusters. Another approach is to use the \"cutting the tree\" method, where the dendrogram is horizontally intersected at a specific height to form the desired number of clusters."
